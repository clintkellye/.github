## Understanding Coin Master Village Costs

### The Basics of Village Building

Coin Master is a game where players progress through various villages, each with its own set of upgrades.

2. **Type of Upgrade**: Some upgrades are more expensive than others (e.g., building a new structure vs. upgrading an existing one).
3. **Card Set Progression**: Completing card sets rewards you with various bonuses that can help lower costs or make upgrades more efficient.
